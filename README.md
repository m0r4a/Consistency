# Consistency

I think that consistency is the key to success.

The objective of this project is keeping me consistent with my programming skills. The goal is to add at least one commit to my GitHub repository every day. If I can't add a commit in a regular project, I will come here and create a small project, script, quirky idea, or anything that comes to my mind so I can keep the consistency.
